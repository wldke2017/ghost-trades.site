# SecureEscrow Functionality Checklist

## ✅ Fixed Issues (2025-01-30)

### Critical Fixes
1. **✅ Dispute Resolution Endpoint** - Added missing `/orders/:id/resolve` endpoint
   - Added `resolveDispute()` function in `services/orderService.js`
   - Added POST route in `routes/orders.js`
   - Handles both 'middleman' and 'buyer' winner scenarios
   - Properly manages wallet balances and commission calculations
   - Emits WebSocket events for real-time updates

2. **✅ Transaction Timestamp Display** - Fixed date field compatibility
   - Updated `app.js` to handle both `createdAt` and `created_at` fields
   - Prevents "Invalid Date" errors in transaction history

3. **✅ API Path Handling** - Verified correct `/escrow` prefix usage
   - All `authenticatedFetch()` calls properly prepend `/escrow` prefix
   - Works in both `auth.js` and `admin-app.js`

JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=escrow_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
COMMISSION_RATE=0.025
```

## Next Steps for Full Testing
1. Start PostgreSQL database
2. Run database migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
3. Start the server: `npm start`
4. Test admin login (Admin/Admin083)
5. Create test middleman account
6. Test all workflows end-to-end
7. Verify WebSocket real-time updates
8. Test mobile responsiveness
9. Check all UI components render correctly
10. Verify currency switching works

## Performance Notes
- Pagination implemented for orders (limit/offset)
- Transaction history pagination
- Efficient database queries with Sequelize includes
- WebSocket for real-time updates (reduces polling)
- Rate limiting on authentication and transactions
